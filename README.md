## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

Every 2 minutes, a woman dies from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth â€” most of them preventable.  
This project aims to **provide an early warning system** using machine learning to evaluate the **risk level during pregnancy**, helping patients and healthcare providers make informed decisions.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

| Model                   | Accuracy | Precision | Recall   | F1 Score |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.97     | 0.94      | 0.97     | 0.95     |
| **Decision Tree**       | 0.97     | 0.98      | 0.94     | 0.96     |
| **CatBoost**            | **0.99** | **0.99**  | **0.98** | **0.98** |

âœ… The **CatBoost** model was chosen for deployment due to its **highest performance**.
